# album-generator
Creates randomly generated band names/album titles/covers.

I built this dumb utility to support the @YourNewAlbum Twitter bot. It generates artists/album names/covers according to the following schema, which I originally saw as a dreadful chain letter on Facebook:

*To Do This*
*1 - Go to "wikipedia." Hit “random” or click http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random*
*The first random wikipedia article you get is the name of your band.*

*2 - Go to "Random quotations" or click http://www.quotationspage.com/random.php3*
*The last four or five words of the very last quote of the page is the title of your first album.*

*3 - Go to flickr and click on “explore the last seven days” or click http://www.flickr.com/explore/interesting/7days*
*Third picture, no matter what it is, will be your album cover.*

*4 - Use photoshop or similar to put it all together.*

*5 - Post it to FB with this text in the "caption" and TAG the friends you want to join in.*
